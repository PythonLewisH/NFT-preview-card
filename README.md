## Overview

First attempt at a HTML/CSS challenege. Far from ideal or best practice but was super useful in figuring stuff out. Used Bootstrap to create.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Looked in detail at the final objective, asked myself what all the elements were, what order they should be created in then started coding.

Decided to practice using Bootstrap, would also help with the mobile responsiveness of the site.

Started with the background, then the bootstrap card and all the contained elements. Tried to match sizing, colours and finishing touches with CSS. 

Fianlly worked on hover states to accurately reflect desired end-product.


### Built with

- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

- Practice with bootstrap 5
- How to start with a blank page and build in the code
- Lots of googling practice!
- Understandng of hover states 
- How to line elements up on the same line.


### Continued development

Would like to try challenge without use of bootstrap. Feel there are more effecient methods for the main hover state on the image, but just found a way to get it done.
